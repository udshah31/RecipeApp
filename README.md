**Modular Android App Development** is a modern approach that divides an app into independent, reusable modules, improving scalability, maintainability, and build efficiency. 

Key components include:  
- **Jetpack Compose** for declarative UI development.  
- **Dagger Hilt** for simplified dependency injection.  
- **Room** for efficient database management.  
- **MVVM Architecture** to separate UI, business logic, and data layers.  

This approach enables clear separation of concerns, faster builds, and easier collaboration while ensuring a scalable and robust app architecture.
